# Calculating Current Yield

Understand how yields are calculated in our protocol and the factors that influence returns.

## Understanding Yield Calculation

The yield calculation in Salvium is based on several factors and metrics that help determine the potential returns for stakers.

### Key Components

1. **Yield per SAL staked:** This is the base metric shown in your wallet (accessible via `yield_info` command in CLI)
2. **Staking period:** Standard period is 21,600 blocks
3. **Your stake amount:** The amount of SAL you plan to stake

### Calculation Process

**Note:** Future yields will differ as TVL for the future is unknown, making precise future yield calculations impossible. This "Yield per SAL staked" figure is shown in the wallet. (In CLI type yield_info to access this data)

#### Example: Estimate potential Yield, calculation

1. **Yield per SAL staked:** 0.00000625 SAL (available in wallet ).
2. **Multiplied:** By 21,600 (staking period).
