# Explorer

The Salvium Explorer is a web-based tool that allows users to browse the Salvium blockchain. It provides comprehensive details about blocks, transactions, addresses, and other essential blockchain metrics. The explorer is an essential resource for users to verify transactions, explore wallet balances, and check the status of the network.

## Key Features

- **Block Information:** View detailed information about each block, including block height, timestamp, miner, and transaction count.
- **Transaction Details:** Examine individual transactions with details such as sender and recipient addresses, transaction amounts, and fees.
- **Address Lookup:** Search for and explore addresses to view their transaction history and current balance.

## Network Status
Monitor real-time network statistics such as hashrate, difficulty, and total SAL supply.

## Transaction Details Page

- **Autorefresh:** Indicates whether the page is set to automatically refresh to show the latest information.
- **Tx hash:** A unique identifier for the transaction. Example: a7e33cf27be57ae622d297293248ac6022f1db6bbff67bdba753330d0c71ad54.
- **Tx public key:** The public key associated with the transaction, used to verify its authenticity. Example: 3cdefa25aa72cb36f20b8e1d26c113161eff86e8fabf9a0289aa691f9a9d0444.
- **Timestamp:** The time when the transaction was added to the blockchain, in Unix epoch time. Example: 1719144227.
- **Timestamp [UTC]:** The timestamp converted to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Example: 2024-06-23 12:03:47.
- **Age [y:d:h:m]:** The time elapsed since the transaction was added to the blockchain. Example: 00:000:00:00:10.

## Block and Fees

- **Block:** The block number in which the transaction was included. Example: 2472.
- **Fee (per_kB):** The transaction fee paid, usually calculated per kilobyte of transaction size. Example: 0.00000000 (0.00000000).

## Transaction Details

- **Tx size:** The size of the transaction in kilobytes. Example: 0.0957 kB.
- **Tx version:** The version of the transaction protocol used. Example: 2.
- **No of confirmations:** The number of times the transaction has been confirmed by the network. Example: 1.
- **RingCT/type:** Indicates if the transaction uses Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) for enhanced privacy and its type. Example: yes/0.
- **Tx Type:** The type of transaction, indicating its origin or purpose. Example: MINER/.

## About TX Type
Different TX Types impact circulating supply in different ways.

1. MINER - increment supply (of SAL, obvs) by the sum of the outputs when adding a TX; decrement supply by the sum of the outputs when deleting a TX (e.g. pop_blocks)
2. PROTOCOL - increment (when adding) / decrement (when popping) supply of specified assets by respective output amounts
3. BURN - decrement (when adding) / increment (when popping) supply of specified asset by tx.amount_burnt
4. CONVERT - decrement (when adding) / increment (when popping) supply of specified asset by tx.amount_burnt
5. STAKE - decrement (when adding) / increment (when popping) supply of specified asset by tx.amount_burnt

## Outputs

- **Output(s):** Details of the outputs generated by the transaction.
  - **Stealth address:** The hidden address used to receive the output, enhancing privacy. Example: 78515d7b983c296214537c4faf361a03ee3cc314948c8ee1625eea7c5c6144a5.
  - **Amount:** The amount of SAL sent in the output. Example: 123.53361924 SAL.
  - **Amount idx:** The index of the amount in the transaction's output list. Example: 2548 of 0.

## Currency and Tag

- **Currency:** The type of currency used in the transaction (Currently just SAL for Salvium transactions).
- **Tag:** Any additional tag associated with the transaction or output, if applicable.
