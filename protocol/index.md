# Protocol Documentation

Welcome to the Protocol documentation section. Here you'll find detailed information about our protocol implementation and specifications.

# Protocol Overview

The Salvium Protocol is a comprehensive blockchain system designed to provide secure, private, and efficient digital transactions. This section provides detailed documentation about the protocol's architecture, features, and implementation.

## Core Components

### 1. Privacy Layer
- Ring signatures for transaction anonymity
- Stealth addresses for recipient privacy
- Confidential transactions for amount privacy

### 2. Consensus Mechanism
- Proof of Work (PoW) mining
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Block time targeting
- Network synchronization

### 3. Transaction System
- UTXO-based transaction model
- Multi-signature support
- Time-locked transactions
- View key functionality

### 4. Network Architecture
- Peer-to-peer network design
- Node communication protocol
- Network security measures
- Blockchain synchronization

## Key Features

### Privacy Protection
The protocol implements multiple layers of privacy protection:
- Transaction amounts are hidden using confidential transactions
- Sender privacy through ring signatures
- Recipient privacy using stealth addresses
- Network-level privacy with encrypted communications

### Scalability
- Efficient block propagation
- Compact block representation
- Transaction batching capabilities
- Optimized memory pool management

### Security
- Cryptographic primitives based on established standards
- Protection against various attack vectors
- Secure key management system
- Regular security audits and updates

## Protocol Specifications

### Block Structure
- Maximum block size: 2MB
- Target block time: 2 minutes
- Difficulty adjustment: Every block
- Emission curve: Gradually decreasing with tail emission

### Transaction Types
1. Standard Transactions
   - Regular peer-to-peer transfers
   - Multi-signature transactions
   - Time-locked transactions

2. Protocol-Level Transactions
   - Mining rewards
   - Governance operations
   - Network upgrades

3. Special Transactions
   - Burn transactions
   - Staking operations
   - Smart contract interactions

## Development and Implementation

The protocol is implemented with a focus on:
- Code maintainability and modularity
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Clear documentation and specifications
- Regular security reviews and updates
