# Smart Contracts in Salvium

Salvium implements a unique approach to smart contracts that maintains privacy while enabling programmable transactions. This document explains how smart contracts work in the Salvium ecosystem.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Privacy-Preserving Design
Salvium's smart contracts are designed with privacy as a core feature:
- Contract state remains confidential
- Transaction amounts are hidden
- Contract interactions preserve user anonymity
- Selective disclosure capabilities

### Contract Types

#### 1. Standard Contracts
- Basic token contracts
- Multi-signature wallets
- Time-locked transactions
- Atomic swaps

#### 2. Privacy Contracts
- Confidential token transfers
- Zero-knowledge proofs integration
- Ring signature contracts
- Stealth address generation

#### 3. DeFi Contracts
- Decentralized exchanges
- Lending protocols
- Yield farming
- Liquidity pools

## Implementation Details

### Contract Execution
1. **Verification Process**
   - Input validation
   - State transition verification
   - Privacy preservation checks
   - Output commitment validation

2. **State Management**
   - Confidential state storage
   - State transition mechanisms
   - Rollback capabilities
   - State synchronization

### Security Features
- Formal verification support
- Audit-friendly design
- Built-in security checks
- Rate limiting mechanisms

## Development Framework

### Contract Development
```solidity
// Example of a basic private token contract
contract PrivateToken {
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) private balances;
    
    function transfer(
        bytes32 recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes proof
    ) external {
        require(verifyProof(proof), "Invalid proof");
        // Transfer logic with privacy preservation
    }
}
```

### Testing and Deployment
1. **Local Testing**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Privacy tests
   - Performance benchmarks

2. **Deployment Process**
   - Security audit
   - Testnet deployment
   - Mainnet preparation
   - Post-deployment monitoring

## Best Practices

### Security Guidelines
1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all inputs thoroughly
   - Check proof validity
   - Verify transaction constraints
   - Monitor gas usage

2. **Privacy Considerations**
   - Use zero-knowledge proofs where appropriate
   - Implement proper key management
   - Maintain transaction privacy
   - Handle metadata carefully

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient proof generation
- Optimized state transitions
- Minimal gas usage
- Batch processing support

## Interacting with Smart Contracts

### Using the CLI
```bash
# Deploy a new contract
salvium-cli deploy --contract TokenContract --params '{"name": "PrivateToken", "symbol": "PRV"}'

# Interact with a contract
salvium-cli contract-call --address 0x123... --method "transfer" --params '{"recipient": "0x456...", "amount": 100}'
```

### Using the RPC API
```json
{
  "method": "contract_deploy",
  "params": {
    "contract": "TokenContract",
    "constructor_params": {
      "name": "PrivateToken",
      "symbol": "PRV"
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Development

### Planned Features
- Advanced privacy primitives
- Cross-chain integration
- Layer 2 scaling solutions
- Enhanced DeFi capabilities

### Research Areas
- New privacy techniques
- Scaling solutions
- Cross-chain privacy
- Advanced cryptographic methods
