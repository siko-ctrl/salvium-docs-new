# About Privacy

Privacy is a fundamental aspect of our protocol. This section covers the privacy features and mechanisms implemented in our system.

## Core Privacy Features

Salvium implements several key privacy features:

- Transaction Privacy
- Address Obfuscation
- Network Layer Privacy
- Optional Transparency

## Privacy Considerations

When using Salvium, be aware of these privacy considerations:

- Staking: The act of staking and receiving rewards may create patterns that could potentially be analyzed to infer information about a user's holdings.
- DeFi Interactions: Engaging with DeFi protocols may require revealing certain information to interact with smart contracts effectively.

It is crucial for users to read the relevant documentation for each feature to understand its specific privacy implications. The Salvium team is committed to maximizing privacy even in these more complex interactions, but users should make informed decisions based on their privacy needs.
