# Exchange Mode in Salvium CLI Wallet

Guide to using the exchange mode features in the Salvium CLI wallet.

Exchange Mode is a specialized set of features in the Salvium CLI Wallet designed to help exchanges comply with MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulations. This mode ensures that received payments can be securely and accurately returned if necessary, maintaining regulatory compliance while preserving Salvium's privacy features.

## Key Components of Exchange Mode

Exchange Mode operates in two main parts:

1. **Freezing Incoming Payments:** This feature prevents received funds from being used in other transactions or fees, ensuring they can be returned in their entirety if needed.
2. **Return Payment Functionality:** Allows for the precise return of received payments to their original sender.

### Freezing Incoming Payments

#### Purpose:
- Prevents received payments from being inadvertently used in other transactions or fees.
- Guarantees that the exact amount received can be returned if necessary.

#### Commands:
1. To enable freezing of incoming payments: `set freeze-incoming-payments 1`
2. To disable freezing of incoming payments: `set freeze-incoming-payments 0`

#### Effects:
- When enabled, this feature ensures that specific outputs received remain available for return.
- It's recommended to keep this feature enabled for exchanges to maintain compliance with regulations.

### Processing a Return Payment

To return a payment to its original sender:

**Command:** `return_payment <tx ID>`

Replace `<tx ID>` with the transaction ID of the payment you wish to return.

#### Function:
- This command facilitates the exact return of the received amount.
- It maintains compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring the precise funds are returned.

## Important Considerations

1. **Regulatory Compliance:**
   - Exchange Mode is designed specifically to support MiCA regulations.
   - It allows exchanges to operate with Salvium while adhering to legal requirements.

2. **Exact Fund Return:**
   - The combination of freezing incoming payments and the return_payment function ensures that the exact received funds can be returned.
   - This precision is crucial for regulatory compliance and accurate record-keeping.

3. **Operational Impact:**
   - Exchanges should be aware that enabling freeze-incoming-payments may affect how received funds can be used or moved within the wallet.
   - It's important to balance compliance needs with operational efficiency.

## Best Practices for Exchanges

1. **Enable Freeze-Incoming-Payments:**
   - Keep this feature enabled by default to ensure compliance readiness.

By providing the ability to freeze incoming payments and process exact returns, it bridges the gap between Salvium's privacy-focused design and regulatory requirements.
