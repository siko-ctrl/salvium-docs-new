# Compliance & Regulatory Framework

## Overview

Salvium is committed to maintaining the highest standards of regulatory compliance while preserving privacy and security. This document outlines our approach to compliance and the measures we take to ensure adherence to relevant regulations.

## Privacy by Design

### Core Principles

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: All transactions utilize zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy while maintaining verifiability
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can choose what transaction information to share and with whom
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central authority controls or has access to user data
- **Data Minimization**: Only essential information is stored on-chain
