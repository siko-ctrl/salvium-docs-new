# Why Salvium

Salvium ($SAL) is a cutting-edge, privacy-focused blockchain platform that combines advanced privacy features with staking, yield generation, and a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance. Launched in 2024, Salvium represents an evolution of privacy-centric cryptocurrencies, built on a fork of the Monero codebase while introducing innovative features to address the challenges of modern decentralized finance (DeFi) and regulatory landscapes.

## Key Features of Salvium:

1. **Enhanced Privacy**: Salvium inherits Monero's robust privacy features, including stealth addresses and ring signatures, ensuring user anonymity in transactions.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: Unlike traditional privacy coins, Salvium is designed with a "privacy-first" approach that also aims for full compliance with regulations such as the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). This includes features like refundable transactions and exchange modes to support regulatory requirements.

3. **Staking and Yield Generation**: Salvium introduces native staking capabilities, allowing SAL token holders to earn rewards by participating in network security. Initially, stakers receive 20% of block rewards, with plans to transition to a fee distribution model based on network usage in the future.

4. **DeFi Capabilities**: The platform is built with DeFi in mind, featuring innovations like Conditional Payments (CP) that enable smart contract functionality and lay the groundwork for a wide range of decentralized financial applications.

5. **Programmable Privacy**: Salvium empowers developers to create DApps with customizable privacy levels, allowing users to selectively share transaction information when required, such as for exchange compliance.

6. **Innovative Technology**: Salvium introduces unique advancements like Transactional Imbalances (TI) and Asynchronous Transactions (AT), which form the foundation of its native staking and yield system.

7. **Mining**: Salvium uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism with the RandomX mining algorithm, ensuring decentralized network security.

8. **Emission Schedule**: The platform features a modified emission schedule compared to Monero, with an initial supply of 184.4 million coins and a tail emission to ensure long-term mining incentives.

Salvium aims to bridge the gap between the privacy needs of users and the transparency requirements of regulators, positioning itself as a forward-thinking solution in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. By offering a balance of privacy, compliance, and DeFi functionality, Salvium seeks to provide a platform that can adapt to future regulatory changes while maintaining the core principles of decentralization and user privacy.
